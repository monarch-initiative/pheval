# PhEval - Phenotypic Inference Evaluation Framework

Many variant prioritization tools (such as [Exomiser](https://exomiser.readthedocs.io/) and other computational approaches rely on ontologies and phenotype matching, sometimes involving complex processes such as cross-species inference. The performance of such tools is exceedingly hard to evaluate, because of the many factors involved: changes to the structure of the ontology, cross-species mappings and semantic similarity algorithms can have significant consequences. Furthermore, the lack of suitable real-world problems/corpora lead to the situation that many algorithms are evaluated using simulations, which may fail to capture real-world scenarios. The lack of an evaluation framework that enables the study of effects on data and knowledge inputs on real world problems makes it difficult to optimize algorithms. To this end we are developing a modular Phenotypic Inference Evaluation Framework (PhEval) which is delivered it as a community resource.
